#Motion
---

*Finally*, the opportunity to change the environment around you.  Some of us believe that music isn't just something that puts people in the mood to shop or drink.  With motion, you can move to make the world into the one in which you want to live- IF you're smart enough.

###MVP
  - A user can create an account.
  - This account will have a securely stored password.
  - A user can create a playlist or join one already in progress.
  - A user can add songs to the playlist, whether the user created it or not.
  - A user can vote to move an item up or down the playlist and their "motion" will carry...
  - ...after the user correctly answers a trivia question.
  - If a motion to table the last song on the list carries, that song is removed from the list.


**Motion** was created primarily with Rails, jQuery and javaScript.

**Motion** uses two APIs: [jService.io](http://www.jservice.io) and the Spotify search database.
